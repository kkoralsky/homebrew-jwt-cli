# Homebrew jwt-cli
> The official homebrew tap for jwt-cli. Because it's not popular enough on its own.

This is a tiny little repo to host a homebrew tap for [jwt-cli](https://github.com/mike-engel/jwt-cli).

```sh
# Tap the repo, if you haven't already
brew tap mike-engel/jwt-cli

# Install the binary to your PATH (like any other brew formula
brew install jwt-cli

# Finally, ensure it works by running the help command
jwt --help
```

## Calculating the SHA256 hash

Because I often forget this, here's how to do it if you have OpenSSL installed locally
